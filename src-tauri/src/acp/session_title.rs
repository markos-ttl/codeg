//! Live ACP session titles.
//!
//! Agents publish a session name through `session_info_update.title`. Codeg
//! used to ignore that field and only adopt a title the next time the
//! conversation was loaded from disk. These helpers extract a usable title
//! from the live notification so the lifecycle worker can write it immediately.
//!
//! Not every agent can push, and Claude Code could not until recently: through
//! claude-agent-acp 0.72.0 its adapter had no wire event for the generated
//! title — it read the name back out of the session file at turn-end — so
//! `acp::background_watch` reads the same `ai-title` / `custom-title` records
//! off the transcript it is already tailing and hands them to
//! [`publish_native_title`], which is the one place that decides whether a
//! title reaches the lifecycle worker.
//!
//! 0.73.0 adds the wire event (`session-titles.js`: Claude Code's own
//! auto-titling never arms under the Agent SDK, so the adapter now asks the CLI
//! via `generate_session_title` and publishes the result as
//! `session_info_update.title`). The CLI stores that title in the session file
//! as an `ai-title` record, which the watcher reads like any other.
//!
//! For Claude the wire is NOT a second producer while codeg can read the
//! transcript ([`accept_wire_title`], [`release_held_wire_title`]). The
//! adapter publishes what the Agent SDK reports for the session: its custom or
//! AI title when it has one, else its `summary`, which is the newest
//! `last-prompt` record (then a summary record, then the first prompt), every
//! value collapsed and cut by its `sanitizeTitle`. codeg's history parser,
//! on every detail fetch, titles an untitled session by its first prompt
//! (reference links folded), and neither it nor the transcript watcher
//! (`acp::background_watch`, which reads only `custom-title` and `ai-title`
//! records) collapses a stored title's spacing. So whenever the CLI cannot
//! generate a title, as through a gateway that refuses the title request,
//! adopting the wire title made it and the next detail fetch write different
//! names in turn: the sidebar row and a bound chat-channel topic flipped after
//! the first turn and again after a resume. (qqq) of the Claude Code entry in
//! `acp::registry` has the measurement. Every other title the wire reports is
//! a transcript record too (the CLI appends a custom title before it writes
//! its sidecar copy, and stores a generated one as an `ai-title` record), so
//! dropping the wire title loses nothing while the transcript can be read.
//!
//! Each connection therefore has one live title writer: the notification loop
//! for every other agent, the watcher's task for Claude (its transcript titles
//! and, while it reads no transcript, the held wire title).
